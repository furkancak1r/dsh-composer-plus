# dsh-composer-plus — next release (0.6.0)

## Objective
1. Codex-style **Changes** panel in dsh's right sidebar: Uncommitted / Unstaged / Staged / Branch (vs upstream) / Last turn, with per-file diffs.
2. Publish to **npm** so the Plugins page installs it by name.
3. **dsh 0.2.1** compatibility check + GitHub Actions CI running `npm test` on every push.
4. **Richer notifications**: approval names the tool, question shows its first line, finish shows a short reply preview; Dock unread badge.
5. **Persist Auto Review "Allow for this chat" grants** across restarts (opt-in per grant, revocable).

Out of scope (user decision): Interrupt-and-send, edit-last-message.

## Invariants
- Client-only features stay client-only; the Host half only adds the git/grant endpoints.
- No shell interpolation: git runs through dsh's `subprocess` capability with argv arrays, a scrubbed env, a timeout and bounded output (same as dsh-workspace-changes). Read-only git commands only.
- Endpoints are registered through `ctx.connection.fetch.register` (auth + host fence are applied by dsh).
- Never edit live dsh files mid-turn; back up before install; never restart dsh.
- Public repo: no local paths, emails, tokens or real DB names.

## Phases & checks
| Phase | Work | Check |
|---|---|---|
| A | Host: `/api/composer-plus.changes` (git status/diff for a session cwd, modes uncommitted/unstaged/staged/branch) | node test with a temp git repo |
| B | Client: right-sidebar tab kind `composer-plus-changes`, mode menu, file list, diff view; guide entry | browser test in isolated profile |
| C | Notifications detail + badge | unit test + browser e2e with fake model |
| D | Persisted grants (host file under DSH_HOME, per session+tool) | unit test |
| E | dsh 0.2.1 run + CI workflow + npm publish | CI green, `npm view` |

## Decisions
- Last turn reuses dsh's own `changes-review` tab (opens it for the latest `workspace/changes` event); no duplicate recorder.
- Branch mode diffs `merge-base(HEAD, @{upstream})..worktree`; falls back to `origin/HEAD` then shows "no upstream".
- Grants persist in `$DSH_HOME/storages/dsh-composer-plus/grants.json` keyed by session id; revoke deletes them.

## Last checkpoint
- Phase A done: host git/grants endpoints + test/changes.test.mjs (temp repo, routes, path refusal).
- Phase B done: Changes tab verified in isolated dsh web (list, diff, Staged empty state, menu incl. Last Turn).
- Phase C done (unit): richer notification bodies + dock badge in test/notify.test.mjs.
- Phase D done (unit): grants persisted via host endpoint.
- Phase E: CI green on GitHub (5bf543e). dsh 0.2.1-alpha.2 verified in an isolated install: Changes, Continue, right-click deeplink, /plan, queue grips, Auto Review card button, grants surviving a restart. npm publish blocked: this machine has no npm login (web login not completed).

## Issues found in 1.0.0 (2026-10-13)
- **F-01 (P1) Service features couldn't be switched off — fixed locally, unreleased.** `injectScope` returned the Cordis fiber from `ctx.inject` as a disposer, so `apply()` threw `TypeError: off is not a function` for notifications, activeProjectsFirst, changesPanel and allowForChat (switch off and plugin unload). Fix: `injectScope` returns `() => fiber.dispose()`. Verified: `npm test` (10 files pass); isolated dsh 0.2.1 and 0.2.0-rc.2 switch all four off and back on with no page errors. Close after the 1.0.1 release.
- **F-02 (P2) Tests hid F-01 — fixed locally.** Fake `ctx.inject` in `test/toggles.test.mjs`, `test/chat-grant.test.mjs`, `test/notify.test.mjs` now returns `{dispose}` like Cordis. `toggles.test.mjs` fails on 1.0.0 client.js and passes with the fix.
- **F-03 (P3) Order change is permanent — documented locally.** Setting description (en/zh) and README now say moves are saved and switching off keeps the current order.
- Needs evidence (open): project-status `MutationObserver` watches all of `document.body`; measure cost during a streaming reply before narrowing it.
